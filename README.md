# Time Conversion 
Time Conversion is a Java console application designed to practice user input, method creation, and basic unit conversions - with a fun twist! Instead of converting seconds into typical time units, this program translates them into units such as **decaseconds**, **jiffies**, **New York minutes**, **nanocenturies**, and **scarmuccis**. 
> This project was completed as part of ITSC 1212 - Introduction to Computer Science I at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

## Features 
- **Interactive CLI**: Prompts the user to enter their name and a time in seconds
- **Custom Time Unit Conversions**:
  - **Decaseconds**: 1 decasecond = 10 seconds
  - **Jiffies**: 1 jiffy = 10 milliseconds
  - **New York Minutes**: 1 NY minute = 1/20th of a second
  - **Nanocenturies**: 1 nanocentury = 3.156 seconds
  - **Scarmuccis**: 1 scarmucci = 11 days
